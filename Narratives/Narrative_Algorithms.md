# Narrative for Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Structures
Max Dunphy

## Briefly Describe the Artifact. What Is It? When Was It Created?
The artifact is the Contact Management Web Application, originally a Java-based console system developed during my CS 320 course in [e.g., Spring 2024], comprising Contact.java, ContactService.java, ContactTest.java, and ContactServiceTest.java. This initial version used in-memory storage with basic CRUD operations and validation. For Milestone Two, completed on July 20, 2025, I transformed it into a full-stack web application using React (ContactManager.jsx with ContactManager.css) and Express (server.js), introducing a responsive UI, RESTful API, and advanced validation. For Milestone Three, I further enhanced this application on July 27, 2025, by optimizing its backend data management with advanced algorithms and data structures, building on the existing web infrastructure to improve search and retrieval efficiency.

## Justify the Inclusion of the Artifact in Your ePortfolio. Why Did You Select This Item? What Specific Components of the Artifact Showcase Your Skills and Abilities in Algorithms and Data Structures? How Was the Artifact Improved?
I selected this artifact for my ePortfolio because it serves as a comprehensive showcase of my growth across multiple computer science competencies, now extending from software design to algorithms and data structures. The original CS 320 project laid a foundation in object-oriented programming and unit testing, while the Milestone Two web port demonstrated my full-stack development skills. For this enhancement, the updated server.js file highlights my proficiency in algorithms and data structures by replacing the array-based contact storage with a Map (simulating a TreeMap-like structure) for sorted key access and implementing a binary search algorithm for efficient contact retrieval, reducing average-case search complexity from O(n) to O(log n). The addition of a performance benchmarking endpoint (/performance) further showcases my ability to evaluate and optimize computing solutions. The artifact was improved by integrating these algorithmic enhancements, ensuring sorted contact display, and providing measurable performance gains, addressing limitations in the previous linear search approach and reinforcing its professional value.

## Did You Meet the Course Outcomes You Planned to Meet with This Enhancement in Module One? Do You Have Any Updates to Your Outcome-Coverage Plans?
In Module One, I planned to meet Outcome 3 (design and evaluate computing solutions using algorithmic principles) and Outcome 4 (use innovative techniques in computing practices) with this enhancement. The implementation of binary search and the transition to a sorted Map structure fulfill Outcome 3 by optimizing contact retrieval and managing trade-offs between memory usage and search efficiency, while the performance benchmarking endpoint supports Outcome 4 by employing innovative tools to assess improvements. Building on the security progress (Outcome 5) from Milestone Two with CORS and validation, I will update my outcome-coverage plan to focus Outcome 5 on the upcoming Databases enhancement (e.g., secure data persistence), ensuring comprehensive coverage across all three categories by the courseâ€™s end.

## Reflect on the Process of Enhancing and Modifying the Artifact. What Did You Learn as You Were Creating It and Improving It? What Challenges Did You Face?
Enhancing this artifact for algorithms and data structures was a deeply educational extension of the Milestone Two process, further solidifying my full-stack development expertise. I learned to integrate algorithmic optimizations into a web application, gaining a deeper understanding of binary search efficiency and the benefits of sorted data structures like Map over arrays, particularly in managing large datasets. The process also sharpened my skills in performance analysis, as I implemented and interpreted benchmarking results to quantify improvements. A significant challenge was adapting the binary search to handle alphanumeric IDs, requiring iterative adjustments to the sorting and comparison logic to avoid errors with mixed data types. Another hurdle was ensuring compatibility between the React frontend and the updated backend sorting mechanism, which necessitated careful synchronization of state updates in ContactManager.jsx. These challenges taught me the importance of rigorous testing across layers and reinforced my ability to troubleshoot and refine complex systems, enhancing my confidence in delivering scalable, efficient solutions.
