# Narrative for Enhancement One: Software Design/Engineering

## Briefly Describe the Artifact. What Is It? When Was It Created?
The artifact is a Contact Management Web Application, an enhanced version of a Java-based contact management system originally developed during my CS 320 course in [insert original creation date, e.g., Spring 2024]. The original artifact, comprising Contact.java, ContactService.java, ContactTest.java, and ContactServiceTest.java, was a console-based application that allowed users to add, update, delete, and view contacts using in-memory storage with basic validation. For Milestone Two, I ported this functionality to a web platform, creating a React frontend (ContactManager.jsx with ContactManager.css) and a Node.js/Express backend (server.js), completed on July 20, 2025. This enhancement introduces a responsive user interface, RESTful API support, and advanced validation, significantly expanding its usability and professionalism.

## Justify the Inclusion of the Artifact in Your ePortfolio. Why Did You Select This Item? What Specific Components of the Artifact Showcase Your Skills and Abilities in Software Development? How Was the Artifact Improved?
I selected this artifact for my ePortfolio because it exemplifies my growth in software design and engineering, a core competency of the Computer Science program. The original CS 320 project provided a solid foundation in object-oriented programming and unit testing, but its limitations—such as the lack of a graphical interface and robust server-side logic—motivated me to enhance it. The enhanced version showcases my ability to design and implement a full-stack web application, integrating frontend (React) and backend (Express) technologies. Specific components highlighting my skills include:
- React UI Development: The ContactManager.jsx component demonstrates my proficiency in building interactive, responsive interfaces with state management, form validation (e.g., email and phone regex), and error handling, using Bootstrap for styling.
- RESTful API Design: The server.js file showcases my ability to create a secure, scalable API with CRUD operations, CORS configuration, and logging using Winston, managing trade-offs like in-memory storage for simplicity.
- Innovative Techniques: The addition of custom CSS (ContactManager.css) with animations and accessibility features, along with JSDoc documentation, reflects my use of modern tools to enhance user experience and maintainability.
The artifact was improved by transitioning from a console application to a web app, adding a visually appealing UI, synchronizing validation across client and server, and implementing logging for debugging. These enhancements address design flaws in the original, such as limited accessibility and scalability, making it a stronger demonstration of my skills.

## Did You Meet the Course Outcomes You Planned to Meet with This Enhancement in Module One? Do You Have Any Updates to Your Outcome-Coverage Plans?
In Module One, I planned to meet outcomes related to software design and engineering (Outcome 4) and professional communication (Outcome 2). This enhancement aligns with Outcome 4 by employing innovative techniques (e.g., React, Express, custom styling) to deliver a valuable solution, and Outcome 2 by adding comprehensive JSDoc and a narrative to communicate my process effectively. I also made progress toward Outcome 5 (security mindset) by implementing CORS and input validation to mitigate potential vulnerabilities, though this was not initially planned. No updates to my outcome-coverage plans are necessary, as the current work sufficiently addresses my goals, with the added security aspect as a bonus.

## Reflect on the Process of Enhancing and Modifying the Artifact. What Did You Learn as You Were Creating It and Improving It? What Challenges Did You Face?
Enhancing this artifact was a rewarding yet challenging process that deepened my understanding of full-stack development. I learned to integrate frontend and backend technologies seamlessly, appreciating the importance of consistent validation across both layers to ensure data integrity. The process also honed my skills in responsive design and debugging, as I adapted the UI for various screen sizes and resolved issues like cross-origin request errors. A significant challenge was synchronizing the client-side and server-side validation logic, particularly for the id field, where I had to adjust duplicate checks for edit mode to avoid conflicts. Another hurdle was configuring Winston logging, which required learning file handling and error logging best practices. These challenges taught me resilience and the value of iterative testing, reinforcing my ability to manage trade-offs and deliver a polished product. Overall, this experience solidified my confidence in applying software engineering principles to real-world problems.
