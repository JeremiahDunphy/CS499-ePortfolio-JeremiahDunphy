# Narrative for Enhancement Three: Databases
Max Dunphy

## Briefly Describe the Artifact. What Is It? When Was It Created?
The artifact is the Contact Management Web Application, initially developed as a Java console app during my CS 320 course in Spring 2024, comprising Contact.java, ContactService.java, ContactTest.java, and ContactServiceTest.java. It evolved into a React/Express web app in Milestone Two (July 20, 2025) and was optimized with algorithms in Milestone Three (July 27, 2025). For Milestone Four, completed on August 04, 2025, I enhanced it by integrating a MySQL database for persistent storage, updating server.js to manage CRUD operations with MySQL and refining ContactManager.jsx to align with the database-driven backend while preserving its enhanced UI features.

## Justify the Inclusion of the Artifact in Your ePortfolio. Why Did You Select This Item? What Specific Components of the Artifact Showcase Your Skills and Abilities in Software Development? How Was the Artifact Improved?
I selected this artifact for my ePortfolio because it demonstrates my comprehensive skill development across software design, algorithms, and databases, reflecting my readiness as a computer science professional. The updated server.js showcases my ability to integrate MySQL, design a relational schema, and implement secure CRUD operations with parameterized queries, highlighting expertise in database management and security (Outcome 5). The enhanced ContactManager.jsx displays my proficiency in building a user-friendly React interface with robust validation and real-time interaction with the database. The improvement from in-memory storage to MySQL persistence eliminates data loss on server restarts, while the refined UI enhances usability, making the artifact a robust, professional-quality solution.

## Did You Meet the Course Outcomes You Planned to Meet with This Enhancement in Module One? Do You Have Any Updates to Your Outcome-Coverage Plans?
In Module One, I planned to meet Outcome 4 (innovative techniques) and Outcome 5 (security mindset) with this enhancement. The MySQL integration and RESTful API design fulfill Outcome 4 by leveraging modern tools for persistent data management, while parameterized queries and input validation address Outcome 5 by mitigating SQL injection risks. Having achieved these, my outcome-coverage plan is complete, with all three categories (Software Design, Algorithms, Databases) enhanced. No further updates are needed, as this concludes the planned enhancements.

## Reflect on the Process of Enhancing and Modifying the Artifact. What Did You Learn as You Were Creating It and Improving It? What Challenges Did You Face?
Enhancing the artifact with MySQL was a valuable learning experience that deepened my understanding of database-driven applications. I gained insights into designing a relational schema, optimizing SQL queries, and ensuring data integrity, which I applied while resolving connection issues during setup. A significant challenge was configuring MySQL credentials and handling initial dependency errors (e.g., missing mysql2 module), requiring careful troubleshooting and package installation. Another hurdle was aligning the enhanced React UI with the database backend, particularly removing client-side sorting to rely on MySQLâ€™s ORDER BY, which taught me the importance of consistent data management between frontend and backend. These challenges enhanced my problem-solving skills and reinforced my ability to deliver secure, scalable solutions.
