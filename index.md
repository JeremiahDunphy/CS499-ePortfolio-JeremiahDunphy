## Professional Self-Assessment

Throughout my journey in the CS 499 capstone course, I have significantly enhanced my professional skill set, encompassing collaboration, effective communication, and advanced technical expertise. My academic foundation, built through coursework such as CS 320 (Software Engineering) and IT 145 (Introduction to Software Development), has been further strengthened by the comprehensive enhancement of the Contact Management Web Application. This project exemplifies my evolution into a proficient full-stack developer, integrating modern technologies and best practices across multiple domains.

Key technical achievements include the development of a React-based user interface, which showcases my proficiency in creating responsive, user-centric designs with robust state management and validation. The implementation of an AVL tree data structure demonstrates my ability to optimize algorithmic performance, reducing search complexity from O(n) to O(log n). Additionally, the integration of a MySQL database highlights my expertise in database design, secure data persistence, and the application of security principles such as parameterized queries to mitigate risks like SQL injection.

These artifacts, culminating in a fully integrated complete project, reflect a cohesive and versatile skill set that aligns with industry standards. This experience has prepared me for a successful career in software development, equipping me with the ability to tackle complex challenges, collaborate effectively with diverse teams, and deliver innovative, scalable solutions. I am confident in my readiness to contribute to dynamic technology environments, leveraging my technical acumen and commitment to continuous improvement.
