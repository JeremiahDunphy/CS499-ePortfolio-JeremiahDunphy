# CS 499 ePortfolio - [Your Name]

## Professional Self-Assessment

Completing CS 499 has sharpened my skills in collaboration, communication, and technical expertise. Coursework like CS 320 and IT 145, combined with enhancing the Contact Management Web Application, has prepared me for full-stack development. The React UI demonstrates my software design ability, the AVL tree my algorithmic skills, and MySQL integration my database and security mindset. These artifacts, culminating in the complete project, showcase a cohesive skill set, positioning me for industry roles.
